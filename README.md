* Learn about **paging** and **infinite scrolling** in web ui
* Leverage Netlify and DataStax Astra DB

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è 

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*

> There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * git installed on your local system
> * [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)
>
> You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

- *What other prerequisites are there?*
> * You will need a github account
> * You will also need Netlify and Astra DB accounts, but we'll work through that in the exercises
> * Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*

> Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homeworks detailed below and you will get a nice badge.

# Part 1 - DB Setup & Data Ingest

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database

> *When creating your instance use the promotion code **ANIA200** to get 200$ of free credit allowing you about 30 million writes + 30 Million reads  + 50GB a month of monthly storage!!*

**`ASTRADB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

‚úÖ **Step 1a:** Click the button to login or register with Datastax. You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

<a href="https://astra.dev/12-3"><img src="img/create_astra_db.png?raw=true" /></a>
- <details><summary>Show me!</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true" />
</details>

**Use the following values when creating the database**
|Field| Value|
|---|---|
|**database name**| `workshops` |
|**keyspace**| `netflix` |
|**Cloud Provider**| *Use the one you like, click a cloud provider logo,  pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region.* |

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![image](./tutorial/images/db-pending.png)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 2. Create a security token

‚úÖ  **Step 2a:**  [Create a token for your app](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to use in the settings screen. Use "Database Administrator" permission.

‚úÖ  **Step 2b:**  Copy the token value (eg `AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c....`) in your clipboard and save the CSV, this value would not be provided afterward.

## 3. Create table **genre** with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 3a:** Open **GraphQL Playground** by 
1. Click on your active database
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click `GRAPHQL API`
4. Click link to your playground.

*As show on the picture below.*
![image](img/open-playground.png?raw=true)

> *Note that values in the picture do no reflect the database name `workshops`, reason is we do not reproduce every picture each time*

‚úÖ  **Step 3b:** In GraphQL Playground, **Populate HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below

![image](img/graphql-playground.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 3c:** In GraphQL Playground, create a table with the following mutation, making sure to replace `netflix` if you used a different name:

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel
```yaml
mutation {
  reference_list: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix",
    tableName:"reference_list",
    ifNotExists:true
    partitionKeys: [ 
      { name: "label", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [
      { name: "value", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
  )
}
```
* Use the arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

## 4. Insert data in the Table with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 4a:** In graphQL playground, change tab to now use `graphql`. Edit the end of the URl to change from `system` to the name of your keyspace: `netflix`

‚úÖ  **Step 4b:** Populate **HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below (again !! yes this is not the same tab)

![image](img/graphql-playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 4c:** In GraphQL Playground,populate the `reference_list` table with the following values

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel

## 7. Insert Values in Movie table

‚úÖ  **Step 7a:** Move to tab `GRAPHQL`, everything should be set, use the following mutation to populate movies table: 

```yaml
mutation insertMovies {
  inception: insertmovies_by_genre(
    value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2010,
      title:"Inception",
      synopsis:"Cobb steals information from his targets by entering their dreams.",
      duration:121,

    value{title}
    }
  
  prometheus: insertmovies_by_genre(value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2012,
      title:"Prometheus",
      synopsis:"After a clue to mankind's origins is discovered, explorers are sent to the darkest corner of the universe.",
      duration:134,

      duration:145,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/xhhvmj1.mp4"}) {
    value{title}
    }
  }
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](img/graphql-playground-5.png?raw=true)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can find more movie data in the `data` folder, however, we will be doing a bulk import of all this data shortly.

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 8. Retrieve values from Movie tables

‚úÖ  **Step 8a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing tab (yeah) list values from the table with the following command.

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](img/graphql-playground-6.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 8b Enable paging:** For small datasets you can retrieve all values in the table but for performance or network reasons you need to perform paging. Let's do same query as before now asking for a `page size to 2`

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       options: {pageSize: 2},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

![image](tutorial/images/playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 8c: Fetch next page paging:**  Notice that `pageState` is also now returned. Let's use it to fetch the next 2 items (next page). Edit the next query to replace your own pageState `YOUR_PAGE_STATE`

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       options: {pageSize: 2, pageState: "<YOUR_PAGE_STATE>"},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```
 
*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

## 9. Load a CSV DataSet

‚úÖ **Step 9a: Download the dataset**

To download the DATASET, right-click (or CTRL + Click to open in new tab) the button below and download the target file on your machine.

> *If the file opens in the browser save it with the name `movies_by_genre.csv`. This is important as the filename will be the table name.*

<p align="left">
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week3-graphql/main/data/movies_by_genre.csv">
 <img src="https://dabuttonfactory.com/button.png?t=Download Dataset&f=Roboto-Bold&ts=20&tc=fff&hp=20&vp=15&c=11&bgt=unicolored&bgc=15d798" />
</a>
</p>

‚úÖ **Step 9b: Open Astra Data Loader Importer**

- Locate the `Load Data` button to open the Data Loader.

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-0.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 9c: Upload the dataset**

Click on the area Drag n drop a single file and look for the file `movies_by_genre.csv` on your machine, this file has been downloaded in step 9b.

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-1.png?raw=true)

Once the file has been upload notive the `Upload Successful` message in green. You can now click `NEXT`

‚úÖ **Step 9d: Define target table**

- Locate the field Table Name and make sure it is set to `movies_by_genre`

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-2.png?raw=true)

- In `Keys and Clustering` section enter `genre` as the partition key.

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-4.png?raw=true)

You can now click on `NEXT` to move forward.

‚úÖ **Step 9e: Define target database**

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-3.png?raw=true)

Select the database we are currently using:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Target Database** | `workshops` |
| **Target Keyspace** | `netflix` |

and click next to start the process asynchronously.

‚úÖ **Step 9f: Wait for the batch to import your data**

After a few seconds (about 30s) ,you will get an email informing you that the batch has been scheduled.

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-5.png?raw=true)

As you can see the operation here is asynchronous. About a minute later your will get another email to tell you the data has been inserted.

![image](tutorial/images/import-movies-6.png?raw=true)

**Congratulations the Database is SET !!!**

# Part 2 - Build Front-End

## 1. Launch GitPod IDE
- Click the button to launch the GitPod IDE.

* _Supported by <img src="tutorial/images/chrome-logo.svg" height="20"/> Chrome and <img src="tutorial/images/firefox-logo.svg" height="20"/> Firefox_

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix)

   
‚ÑπÔ∏è _It may take minutes (approx. 3-5) for GitPod to fully initialize._


## 2. Serverless Functions

Take a look at `functions/getGenres.js`

``` javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

exports.handler = async function (event) {

  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)
  const url = process.env.ASTRA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
  const query = `
    query getAllGenres {
      reference_list (
        value: { label: "genre"},
        options: {
          pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
          pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
        }
      ) {
        values {
          value
        }
        pageState
      }
    }
  `

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-cassandra-token": process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
  })

  try {
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(responseBody)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify(e)
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice the familiar GraphQL query "getAllGenres" we used previously in the playground. It's been modified a bit to utilize paging.

``` javascript
options: {
  pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
  pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
}
```

This section allows us to pass in the desired page size and current page state from the front-end.

``` javascript
{
  values {
    value
  }
  pageState
}
```

And, in addition to the values of the query, we are also returning the page state from the query.

The serverless function `functions/getMovies.js` works in much the same way, though we pass in the specific genre we want, and are hardcoding the page size to 6.

``` javascript
query {
  movies_by_genre (
    value: { genre: ${JSON.stringify(genre)}},
    orderBy: [year_DESC],
    options: { pageSize: 6, pageState: ${JSON.stringify(pageState)} }
  ) {
    values {
      year,
      title,
      duration,
      synopsis,
      thumbnail
    }
    pageState
  }
}
```

## 3. Fetching from the Front-End

Let's take a look at how we fetch from these serverless functions from the front-end. Start in `src/App.js`

We have a fetch method defined that will retrieve a page of genres by calling the `getGenres` serverless function.

``` javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  if (! isFetching)  {
    setIsFetching(true)
    const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getGenres", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({pageState, pageSize}),
    })
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    setPageState(responseBody.data.reference_list.pageState)
    setGenres(gs => (gs || []).concat(responseBody.data.reference_list.values))
    setIsFetching(false)
  }
}
```

We pass in the current `pageState` and `pageSize` state variables and recieve a response from the serverless function. We then set the `pageState` var to the new pagestate, and set the `genres` state variable to the recieved data. (Note that we are concatenating the new data to the var, since we want to keep all previously fetched data, not replace).

When we render the page, generate a `<Section>` component for each genre, and set a `<div>` to detect a mouseEnter to load the next page of genres.

``` javascript
<>
  <NavBar />
  <HeroSection />
  {genres && (
    <div className="container">
      {Object.values(genres).map((genre) => (
        <Section key={genre.value} genre={genre.value} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
  <div
    className="page-end"
    onMouseEnter={() => {
      setRequestedPage( np => np + 1 )
    }}
  />
</>
```

The `<Section>` component works in the same way, though we will fully replace the data in the `movies` variable.

``` javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getMovies", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ genre: genre, pageState: pageState }),
  })
  const responseBody = await response.json()
  setMovies(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.values)
  setPageState(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.pageState)
}
```

Now that we know how the front-end works, let's launch our app!

## 4. Install the Netlify CLI (Command Line Interface)
 * In the `workshop-graphql-netflix` directory run the following command to install the netlify-cli
 ```
 npm install -g netlify-cli
```

 * <details><summary>Show me!</summary>

    </details>

## 5. Retrieve application token to securely connect to the database

Use the token you previously generated. If you no longer have the token and did not download a .csv, you can generate a new token using [the instructions above](#2-create-a-security-token)

You will also need the GraphQL Endpoint for your keyspace.
First, go to the Astra DB connect page for your database.
![graphql-endpoint-1](tutorial/images/graphql-keyspace-url-01.png)
Then scroll down to find the endpoint for your keyspace.
![graphql-endpoint-1](tutorial/images/graphql-keyspace-url-02.png)

## 6. Configure Environment Variables and Install Dependencies

‚úÖ Create `.env` file (do _not_ leave curly brackets)

```ini
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=REPLACE_ME
ASTRA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=REPLACE_ME
```

![env-file](tutorial/images/env_file.png)


üë©‚Äçüíª  Install all the packages

```bash
npm install
```

## 7. Launch your app
  * Run the application 
  ```
  netlify dev
  ```
  * The application should automatically launch in the GitPod preview pane

## 4. Connect Netlify to your site

Execute each of the commands below to link your code to your Netlify deployment.

‚úÖ **Step 4a:**  we'll need to **STOP** the `netlify dev` command if you still have it running. In the terminal where you executed the netlify command issue a `CTRL+C` (control key + the C key) in order to stop the process.

‚úÖ **Step 4b:** Enter the following command to pop up a browser to authenticate with netlify

  ```
  netlify login
  ```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
```
Opening https://app.netlify.com/authorize?....
‚†ã Waiting for authorization...^C
```

‚úÖ **Step 4c:** Open the link in a new WINDOW for the link to work, and authorize Netlify CLi to access Netlify on your behalf.

  > When using GitPod the preview pane **will not display this properly.** You must click the "open in a new window" button in the very top right of the preview pane._

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

```
You are now logged into your Netlify account!
Run netlify status for account details
To see all available commands run: netlify help
gitpod /workspace/appdev-week3-graphql $ 
```

‚úÖ **Step 4d:** link your workspace to the associated site with the following command

```
netlify link
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

![image](tutorial/images/netlify-link.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 4e:** take the .env file upload it to netlify
  
  ```
  netlify env:import .env
  ```

<!--
  * Will be used to allow you to execute `netlify open`
  ```
  netlify sites:list
  ```
-->

## 5. Deploy to production
Now that you've hooked everything up, time to deploy to production.
